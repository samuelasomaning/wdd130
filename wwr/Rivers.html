            <img class="salmon-river image" src="images/salmon-river-wide.jpg" alt="Salmon River Image">
            <p>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was
                 given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the
                  number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they 
                  never left.</p>

            <p>Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also 
                commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower 
                over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.</p>
                
            <p>Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed 
                rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the 
                early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all 
                summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, 
                warmer water more..</p>

            <img class="desolation-image" src="images/desolation.jpg" alt="Desolation Canyon Image">
            <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green 
                river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert 
                scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to 
                Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic 
                formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.
            </p>

            <p>Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days
                
                Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  This designation is based on the 
                uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.</p>

            <p>This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will never forget 
                your visit to the Grand Canyon.</p>

            <p>Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make 
                one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater 
                rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.
            </p>

            <p>
                CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are 
                technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. 
                However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to 
                both.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?
            Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over the 
            age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are 
            all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a 
            boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. The areas we 
            are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you 
            might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things very interesting. Each boat 
            also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river guides are unable to go for very long at all
            without telling stories...some of which are even true!</li>
            <li>Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?
                    As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure 
                    your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 
                    years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on 
                    land.
                    Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal 
                    flotation device (PFD). Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your 
                    guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining 
                    what you should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.</li>
            <li>What is included in the trip?
                    We will provide all necessary camping equipment. This includes a sleeping bag, foam pad, 
                    waterproof duffle bag, small waterproof day bag, tent and a cot, eating utensils and camping 
                    chair.
                    We provided water and lemonade during the day. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate are provided 
                    during the morning and evening hours. You may bring beer, liquor and soft drinks (in 
                    reasonable amounts, 2 cans per day). You may purchase these items either the night before 
                    the trip, or on your way to the put-in. 3 meals per day, plus snacks</li>
            <li>What do I need to bring?
                    The most effective way to plan for temperature and weather changes in the Canyon is to be 
                    prepared for both hot & dry and cold & wet Rain jacket and rain pants- do not bring ponchos

                    of quick dry shorts and the shirt of your choice (polypropylene if you are cold, cotton if 
                    you are hot). Two piece swim suits are convenient when changing or going to the bathroom. hat-

            <li>What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?
                    Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater rafting!...Let's describe a common day 
                    on the river.
                    Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful starry 
                    sky. Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack 
                    your things and prepare for the day. The day is filled with some combination of swift water, 
                    rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, and more good food. We try to hit camp around 
                    4 or 5, after setting up your cot you can relax with a good book or good company by the river, 
                    or explore around camp while your guides prepare your dinner...something perhaps like steak 
                    and potatoes, or grilled salmon...and dutch oven brownies...you won't forget the dutch oven 
                    brownies. After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be able to talk your guide into 
                    another story or two to send you off to bed under more stars than you thought were possible.</li>
            <li>How far in advance should I book my trip?
                    If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in advance. If you can be 
                    more flexible 6 months in advance is usually sufficient.</li>
